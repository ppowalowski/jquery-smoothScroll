jquery-smoothscroll
===================

Simple plugin for smooth scrolling to anchor elements (just add to page and enjoy). This is a fixed and upgraded version of another original project I can't find to credit appropriatly. Feel free to contact me if you recognize the source.

Usage
-----

It's as simple as adding the script anywhere on the page. No code needed.

### prevent animation selectively

If you wish not to scroll smothly when pressing a certain link just add `data-noscroll` as attribute. Like so:
```
<a href="#anchor" data-noscroll>basic anchor</a>
```
